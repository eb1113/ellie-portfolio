## Featured Projects
### Shortest Path
#### Project Summary

This project implements both Dijkstra’s and A* search algorithms to find the shortest paths between points in real world city road networks. The program uses map data from the Bridges API to model roads as weighted graphs, where each node represents an intersection and edges represent distances between them.

By comparing the performance and output of the two algorithms, the project visualizes how city design and road connectivity affect travel efficiency. The visualization highlights areas where city layouts lead to inefficient or indirect routes.

#### Reflection

I chose this project because it demonstrates my ability to implement and compare classic graph search algorithms in a real-world context. Working with map data helped me see how algorithmic design can reveal inefficiencies in urban systems connecting computation to tangible societal issues.

This project directly supports the Computer Science learning goals of problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and software development. It also relates to the Westminster-wide goals of Critical Thinking and Global Responsibility, since it required me to evaluate how algorithmic insights can inform better infrastructure design and urban planning decisions.
