Hi! I’m Ellie Berg, a Computer Science major at Westminster University with interests in algorithms and computer graphics.  
This portfolio showcases selected projects from my coursework and independent work in computer science.

## Featured Projects
### Shortest Path
#### Project Summary

This project implements both Dijkstra’s and A* search algorithms to find the shortest paths between points in real world city road networks. The program uses map data from the Bridges API to model roads as weighted graphs, where each node represents an intersection and edges represent distances between them.

By comparing the performance and output of the two algorithms, the project visualizes how city design and road connectivity affect travel efficiency. The visualization highlights areas where city layouts lead to inefficient or indirect routes.

#### Reflection

I chose this project because it demonstrates my ability to implement and compare classic graph search algorithms in a real-world context. Working with map data helped me see how algorithmic design can reveal inefficiencies in urban systems connecting computation to tangible societal issues.

This project directly supports the Computer Science learning goals of problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and software development. It also relates to the Westminster-wide goals of Critical Thinking and Global Responsibility, since it required me to evaluate how algorithmic insights can inform better infrastructure design and urban planning decisions.

#### Skills Demonstrated

Implementation of Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms

Priority queue and graph data structures

Spatial reasoning and performance comparison

Visualization using the Bridges API

### Frognition (A Children's Math Game)

#### Project Summary

This project is a children’s math game that helps students practice basic addition in a fun and interactive way. The game displays an addition problem at the top of the screen, and the player selects the correct answer by clicking on the fly (or moth) with the right number on its wings.

The game uses a Django backend to manage levels, problems, and user data, and a React frontend for an animated, kid-friendly interface. Teachers can view student progress and performance through a dashboard connected to the database.

#### Reflection

I chose this project because it represents my first full-stack application — where I connected a React frontend to a Django REST API backend. It taught me how to design and integrate both sides of a web application, manage API endpoints, and handle real-time interactions between components.

This project demonstrates several Computer Science learning goals:

Software Design and Development: Creating a maintainable full-stack architecture with reusable components.

Problem Solving and Algorithmic Thinking: Designing logic for random math problems and tracking user correctness.

Communication and Creativity: Designing a playful and intuitive interface for young learners.

Collaboration: Implementing feedback from classmates and testing across browsers.

It also reflects Westminster’s Creativity and Communication learning goals by combining programming with visual design and educational engagement.

#### Skills Demonstrated

Frontend development with React (components, state management)

Backend development with Django (models, serializers, REST endpoints)

API integration and debugging

UI/UX design for educational software

Full-stack deployment planning
